# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsiblity Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to be changed.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

A class should be open to extension but closed to modification.

## Liskov Subsitution Principle (LSP)

You should be able to replace a class with a subclass without the calling code knowing about the change.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Many specific interfaces are better than a single, all-encompassing interface.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Code should depend upon abstractions, not concrete implementations.

### Notes

- this is implemented by dependency injection.
- dependency implementation automated using Inversion Of Control (IOC) containers.

# Software Engineer/Developer, Learner and Gamer

## About me

I am a tech enthusiast, software guru, technology leader with 10+ years of professional experience under my belt. My journey began 15 years ago with QBasic and VB6, and as my interest in game development grew, I expanded my repertoire to include C and C++. Over time, I dabbled in a variety of other programming languages and tools, including Action Script, Lite-C (3D Game Studio), Unity 3D, and 3D modeling software like Autodesk Maya and 3DS Max.

Throughout high school, I devoted myself to learning web development. I became proficient in Python and PHP for backend programming and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend development. My skills continued to evolve in college, where I delved into C#, .Net Framework, and SQL Server, and eventually transitioned to becoming a Full-Stack Software Developer.

Throughout my career, I've focused on developing high-performance software for a range of platforms, including IoT, industrial automation, and stock exchange-related applications, such as online trading. This has allowed me to gain valuable experience in software design and architecture, resulting in the successful creation of numerous high-performance applications.

Throughout my career, I have had the pleasure of working with many programming languages and tools. While I am well-versed in software design and architecture in general, my primary tools of choice are currently C#, .NET, Go, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript/TypeScript. In addition to these, I am also experienced in devops and infrastructure management, which are essential for building and maintaining high-performance software systems. These are just a few examples of the many tools in my expansive toolbox that I use to build and lead technical teams in creating cutting-edge software solutions.

I'm also an avid gamer who loves computer games!
